# WebSite_Development
 In this project, I used backend devices & databases like=> NodeJS, Express, Mongo DB
 After running this project you will see a login page, for that you have to Sign up 
 There is also a DASHBOARD Page only for the admin to change information => (http://localhost:5000/admin/)
 In this, you will see a login page: UserName = AkshatDaiya || Password = Admin
